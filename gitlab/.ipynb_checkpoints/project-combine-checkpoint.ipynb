    "The kinetic energy in the chromosphere is more than 100 times larger than the total energy required to maintain the million-degrees corona. Large part of this kinetic energy is in the form of shocks which are \"channeled\" along the magnetic field forming so-called spicules. Hinode and IRIS observations revealed that the corona is continously protrused anywhere from the chromosphere at any time by spicules of various types. So, it is of great interest on understanding the role of these spicules in the associated coronal-loops. With your code, from a stratified atmosphere such as the one in [Heggland et al. 2007](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/518828/pdf) you will investigate how shocks travel in the chromosphere, transition region and corona. For this, following this reference, drive the bottom boundary with acoustic waves at different frequencies and amplitudes. Can you recognice the different features as the sod-shock test? What is the impact of the thermal conduction in the corona when a shocks travel through? \n",
